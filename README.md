<h1>Mock-Dental-Website</h1>
<h3>A fake dental website for the fictional business "2nd Avenue Dental".</h3>
<br>
Done as a project for a website design & development course in the Fall of 2023. I iteravely designed and developed a website for a fictional dentistry company, with specific client demands such as:
<ul>
  <li>A home page with carousel</li>
  <li>A "Contact Us" form</li>
  <li>A page listing the company's services</li>
  <li>An "About Us" page for their dental team</li>
  <li>A page to submit appointment requests</li>
  <li>A clutter-free design that is easy to navigate and appeals to a wide range of people</li>
</ul>
<h4>Design Process</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I first examined the websites of local dentists in my area and chose elements from their pages that I liked/disliked, incorporating favoured elements into my own unique design.</li>
  <li>I then designed and drafted 10 wireframes** using Balsamiq (2 versions of each page), and put my designs through a heuristic evaluation process to find and improve flaws.</li>
  <li>Finally, I developed the website using <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>. It was put through another heuristic evaluation process and modified, and finally finished ~1 month after first beginning the project.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Features</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Flexible page layout that adjusts to various window/display sizes</li>
  <li>A landing page, about page, services page, contact page, and booking page</li>
  <li>An image carousel on the landing page</li>
  <li>Submittable forms on the contact and booking pages</li>
</ul>

**Wireframes can be found in the /2ndAveWireframes folder
